add app locking,
add more apps, 
add better gestures, 
add an app sdk,
nicer notifs/messagebox's,
add app widgets,
add spliscreen by swiping from the bottom right to the left above the bottom opens a slpitview menu
i want to add app bridges so each app can communicate with rules, like only some content, only to some apps, sometimes requiring permissions, etc
using the bridge i wanna create a way to make the contacts app have access to a bunch of contacts that can be accessed directly from that app
